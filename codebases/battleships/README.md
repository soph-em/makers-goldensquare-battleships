# Battleships Project

This is a project aimed to develop all of your skills so far. **It is designed
to be challenging for most learners on the Makers immersive course.**

Your assignment is to design and test-drive a terminal-based Battleships game. A
small amount of code is already written, to get you started and show you the
approach to building and testing terminal user-interfaces using mocking.

## Getting Started

How to get started:

```shell
; pipenv install # To install dependencies

; pipenv run pytest # All tests should pass
; pipenv run pytest --cov lib # To see test coverage too

; pipenv run python run.py
# This will give you a few prompts and show you a board.
```

You might want to start by reading through the existing code. Since this is
advanced content, there are a few new techniques included for you to
investigate.

After this, pick a few user stories from below, design your classes, and start
test-driving. Note that the classes here are not the full set of classes
necessary for a good program design. As you build, you will need to break apart
classes and add new ones.

## User Stories

Here is the full set of user stories for this game. Some are already
implemented.

```
<!-- As a player
So that I can prepare for the game
I would like to place a ship in a board location -->

<!-- As a player
So that I can play a more interesting game
I would like to have a range of ship sizes to choose from -->

<!-- As a player
So the game is more fun to play
I would like a nice command line interface that lets me enter ship positions and
shots using commands. -->
<!-- 
As a player
So that I can create a layout of ships to outwit my opponent
I would like to be able to choose the directions my ships face in -->

As a player
So that I can have a coherent game
I would like ships to be constrained to be on the board

As a player
So that I can have a coherent game
I would like ships to be constrained not to overlap

As a player
So that I can win the game
I would like to be able to fire at my opponent's board

As a player
So that I can refine my strategy
I would like to know when I have sunk an opponent's ship

As a player
So that I know when to finish playing
I would like to know when I have won or lost

As a player
So that I can consider my next shot
I would like to be able to see my hits and misses so far

As a player
So that I can play against a human opponent
I would like to play a two-player game
```
